**The 2024 HCPC is over, but HCPC will return in 2025!  Watch this
space for announcements, or email [Brent
Yorgey](mailto:yorgey@hendrix.edu) if you'd like to be added to a

<br /><br />

The HCPC is an in-person, **ICPC-style programming contest** hosted at
[Hendrix College](https://www.hendrix.edu/), with both **collegiate**
and **high school** divisions.  Teams of up to three students compete
to solve as many programming challenges as possible during the
five-hour contest.  The HCPC will develop students' teamwork,
programming skills, and the kind of algorithmic thinking and
problem-solving that will truly set them apart in academia and
industry.

See below for the [schedule](#schedule) and [location](#location), to
[register](#registration), or to read the [contest rules](#rules).

Please send any questions to the contest director, [Dr. Brent
Yorgey](mailto:yorgey@hendrix.edu).
