The HCPC is an in-person, **ICPC-style programming contest** hosted at
[Hendrix College](https://www.hendrix.edu/), with both **collegiate**
and **high school** divisions.  Teams of up to three students compete
to solve as many programming challenges as possible during the
five-hour contest.  The HCPC develops students' teamwork,
programming skills, and the kind of algorithmic thinking and
problem-solving that will truly set them apart in academia and
industry.
